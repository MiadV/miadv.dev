## What's the benefit of commit conventions?

Whether you are working alone or as a team it is always essential to define a git commit message convention. Having a well-organized and structured message history could save you a lot of time and effort when it comes to reviewing the commits, finding changes related to a bug, and generally maintaining a repository. It will also make it a lot easier to implement [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and use other git commands like `git shortlog`, `git revert`.

## How to choose the best commit convention?

Depending on the type of project, and your team preference you can choose an existing commit convention or define a custom convention for your project. Whichever you choose, make sure you stick to it and be consistent.

## What is conventional commits specification?

[Conventional Commit Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) is one of the popular commit conventions that you can choose for your project. here we will have a sneak peek at it.

## Commit message structure

According to Conventional Commit Specification messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

1.  **Type:** A commit type must always present and it could be one of the following `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:` and others.

- **`fix:`** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
- **` feat:`** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
- Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.

2. **Scope:** an optional noun may be provided as additional contextual info wrapped in parenthesis. e.g. `feat(auth): support google auth`.
3. **Description:** a description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a summary of the code changes.
   It should be present tense. Not capitalized. No period in the end.‚Äù, and **imperative like the type**.
4. **Body:** a longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
5. **Footer:** one or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value.
