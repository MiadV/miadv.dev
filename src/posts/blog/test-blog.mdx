### Test Blogadwd?

Frontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. @next/mdx does not support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as gray-matter.

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

```js
const doc = getDocBySlug(params.slug);
```

```js {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' });
  }
}
```

# My MDX page

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
| -------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 1 is | left-aligned  | $1600 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
