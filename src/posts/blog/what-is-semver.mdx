## What's Semantic Versioning?

Semantic versioning (AKA [SemVer](https://semver.org/)) is a popular versioning scheme.
It consist of 3-component **number** in the format of **Major.Minor.Patch**

**Major:** should be increased when we interduce **backward-incompatible** API changes
_(once we increase this number we must reset Minor and Patch number to 0)_

```
sample-package@1.5.3 => becomes: 2.0.0
```

**Minor:** should be increased when new changes are **backward-compatible** i.e. None-Breaking change.
_(once we increase this number we must reset Patch number to 0)_

```
sample-package@1.5.3 => becomes: 1.6.0
```

**Patch:** should be increased when there is a backward compatible bug fix.

```
sample-package@1.5.3 => becomes: 1.5.4
```

Keep in mind that when using semantic versioning, versions start from 0.1.0 and not 0.0.1 as no bug fixes have taken place and we usually start with a set of features.
1.0.0 is considered the first stable version and versions before that are related to the development phase.

## Other Versioning Schemes

SemVer is not the only versioning scheme. but it is popular choice amount open source projects.
below is a list of some other schemes you can check.
